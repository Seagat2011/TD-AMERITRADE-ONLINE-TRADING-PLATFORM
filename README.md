Automated online trading platform written in HTML5 CSS3 

## METHODOLOGY

The platform engine is a trend-following artificial neural network, based upon Adrain T. Mitroi's seminal paper, 
"Applied Behavioral Finance: Investor Biases, Performance Reversions to The Mean, And Trend Following", 
published in 2014, during his tenure at The Bucharest Academy of Economics of Romania, 
which states: option strike prices do not often reflect the true intrinsic value of the underlying asset;
thus, market sentiment (ie. the trend) is the largest determinant 
of an option's final value and that an option's ability to correctly correlate to the intrinsic value 
of the underlying financial instrument is often never realized. 

This is why trades are highly leveraged against by brokerage firms before they even reach the open market. 
Brokerage firms, our investment gateways, have realized this and have become reticent to actively trade in the market. 
Instead, they are trading against you!
This is today's legal form of insider trading and it is on a scale of picoseconds (10e-12 seconds).
Adrain T. Mitroi explains in detail how any long-term investment of an equity is guaranteed to lose money. 
Trading Algorithms can avoid these pitfalls that cause humans to sell too soon, or buy too late, or hold a long-term equity position in financial
instrument or asset that will undergo bankruptcy, corporate or government theft, or because of market regulation, innovation, 
or other previously unknown market conditions, eventually go out of business.  

Trend-trading, or trend-following does not take into account general market sentiment, trading volume, market news, or an instrument's access to liquidity -- 
this is highly controversial. 

But trend-trading these multiple "inflection points", a term borrowed from the Mathematics of Calculus to indicate a measured deviation from the Mean 
(ie. The Trend: 1-day Trend,7-day Trend,30-day Trend,Quarterly Trend,90-day Trend,200-day Trend,Annual Trend,Decade Trend, Lifelong Trend) 
adequately indicate when to buy, and when to sell, as reflected in the option's premium and strike-price 
which opens, resumes, or eventually ends the trend.
